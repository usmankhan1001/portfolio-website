  <h2>meaning of life</h2>
  <p><em>Posted on: 29 07 2025</em></p>

  <!-- Start of blog content -->
    <p>This is my first blog post. It talks about life and meaning.</p>

    <p>Here, I reflect on what it means to live intentionally. Is there more than just waking up and going to work?</p>

    <p>I don’t have all the answers, but I want to find them through writing, questioning, and sharing.</p>
