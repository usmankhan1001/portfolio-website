  <h1>Hi, I'm Usman Khan</h1>
  <p>
    I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the <strong>National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)</strong>, one of the top engineering institutions in Pakistan. During my studies, I developed a strong foundation in both theoretical and applied mechanics, with a growing passion for designing intelligent and efficient mechanical systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    A significant part of my academic and project work revolves around <strong>Finite Element Analysis (FEA)</strong>, particularly static structural simulations to assess component strength and safety under expected loads. I also perform <strong>modal analysis</strong> to evaluate vibrational characteristics and avoid critical resonance in sensitive mechanical assemblies.
  </p>
  <p>
    I specialize in 3D CAD modeling using tools like SolidWorks and Fusion 360, turning design ideas into detailed engineering models. These models are not just digital artifacts — I bring them to life using hands-on manufacturing techniques, ensuring the final product performs as intended in the real world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, I’m transitioning into the field of <strong>robotics and artificial intelligence</strong>, integrating mechanical design with smart technologies. My vision is to contribute to systems that are both functionally robust and intelligently responsive — solutions that have practical value and a lasting impact.
