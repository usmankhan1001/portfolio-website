  <h1>Hi, I'm Usman Khan</h1>
  <p>
    I studied Mechanical Engineering, because I figured building things that exist in the real world was marginally more satisfying than just staring at equations. Since then, I've been somewhere between CAD models, finite element meshes, and real machines that either vibrate too much or not enough.
  </p>
  <p>
    My work usually revolves around structural simulations, vibration analysis, and designing components that (ideally) don’t fail under load. I use SolidWorks and </strong>Fusion 360</strong> not just to make 3D models, but to argue with manufacturing realities. Whether it’s fixing stress concentrations or designing a fixture that won’t require five extra hands to assemble — that’s where I’m usually found.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, I’m also pursuing a Master’s degree in Robotics and AI — because apparently, mechanical parts aren’t allowed to just sit still anymore. They now have to think, see, and sometimes ignore commands entirely. So I’m learning how to make things that move smarter, not just smoother.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lately, I've been working in axial flux motor development at an EV startup, where we try to build compact machines that don’t explode under torque. Slowly learning to speak the language of electrons too, mostly out of necessity.

  <h2>Education</h2>

  <h3>MS Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (Ongoing)</h3>
  <p><strong>[University Name]</strong> — Started 2024</p>
  <p>Currently navigating robotics, control systems,machine learning and computer vision — occasionally learning, frequently debugging and crying.</p>

  <h3>BSc Mechanical Engineering</h3>
  <p><strong>National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)</strong> — 2018–2022</p>
  <p>Covered CAD, FEA, thermal systems, and enough math to survive. Did not, however, learn how to argue with vendors or resolve tolerance mismatches — skills acquired later, often the hard way.</p>

  <h2>Experience</h2>

  <h3>Internee – Periodic Maintenance Department</h3>
  <p><strong>Honda Center, Rawalpindi</strong> — Summer Internship</p>
  <p>
    Worked as an internee in the periodic maintenance department. Assisted in routine vehicle services including oil changes, brake inspections, and fluid checks. Observed diagnostic processes and gained exposure to workshop operations and maintenance reporting.
  </p>

  <h3>Mechanical Engineer – Axial Flux Motor Development</h3>
  <p><strong>Wheemo Tech GmbH</strong> — Dec 2022 to Present</p>
  <p>
    Working with a Germany-based EV startup on the design and development of axial flux motors. Involved in creating different versions of the motor platform, including configurations rated for <strong>22 kW and 5 kW outputs</strong>. Responsibilities include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Designing motor assemblies for structural rigidity and ease of assembly</li>
    <li>Performing static structural FEA on rotor supports, mounting brackets, and housing components</li>
    <li>Conducting initial thermal assessment of components during and after testing phases</li>
    <li>Creating detailed 3D models and 2D drawings for manufacturing using Fusion 360</li>
    <li>Applying DFMA principles to optimize designs for CNC machining, casting, and fabrication</li>
    <li>Designing jigs and fixtures for motor sub-assemblies and component alignment</li>
    <li>Coordinating with local vendors for part production and tolerance adjustments</li>
    <li>Participating in motor build stages and assisting electrical teams in testing and validating prototypes</li>
    <li>Led IP (Ingress Protection) testing for motor assemblies, including setup design, execution, and result validation. Collected torque sensor data to compute power losses from axial and radial seals using Excel-based data analytics. Used a thermal imaging camera to measure temperature rise during operation and analyzed the contact behavior and wear patterns of seals under repeated testing cycles.
</li>

  </ul>
